I built up this webapi and use curl to test :curl -d "Name=Dog Shampoo&Price=10.57&Description=shampoo for long hair dogs" -X POST http://localhost:4201/api/Products
It works.
For the Angular part, I know The idea is same, front end send the http request to operate database by using webapi. My Angular still need time to
get familiar with.
